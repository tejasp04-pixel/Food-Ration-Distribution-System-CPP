# Food Ration Distribution Management System (C++)

## 📖 Project Overview
This is a console-based Food Ration Distribution Management System developed using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts.

The system allocates rice quota to citizens based on their annual income and categorizes them under different ration card types (APL, BPL, AAY).
